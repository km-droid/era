Release Management for GDCE Applications

(Unified RM+SRE Model)

1. Context

100+ GDCE-enabled stores are already live, with more onboarding rapidly.

Applications are edge-specific, requiring consistent and reliable deployments.

To scale effectively:

Consolidate into one Release Management + SRE team (RM+SRE).

Simplify engagement model → Developers interact directly with RM+SRE.

2. Organizational Model

RM+SRE Team

Expanded group of SRE engineers with release management responsibilities.

Owns GitHub Config Sync repos (write access restricted to RM+SRE only).

Manages deployment pipelines, staggered/canary rollouts, and monitoring.

Developers

Build and test applications in lower environments (dev/staging).

Submit release requests directly to RM+SRE team.

Provide validation artifacts (unit tests, performance benchmarks, release notes).

3. Deployment Workflow
Step 1 – Dev Testing

Developers validate application functionality in dev/staging.

Perform unit, integration, and load tests.

Step 2 – Release Request

Developer team submits release request to RM+SRE.

Request includes:

Application manifests.

Test and validation evidence.

Release notes and rollout scope.

Step 3 – Staggered Deployment

RM+SRE executes canary rollout strategy:

Phase 1: Deploy to 1% of stores (pilot).

Phase 2: Expand to 5% of stores (early validation).

Phase 3: Roll out to 25% of stores.

Phase 4: Full fleet rollout (100%).

Rollouts can pause or rollback at any stage if issues detected.

Step 4 – Monitoring & Validation

RM+SRE continuously monitors:

Application health and error rates.

Store connectivity.

Performance metrics.

Triggers immediate rollback if KPIs fail thresholds.

Step 5 – Communication

Teams Channel:

Primary interface between Developers and RM+SRE.

Used for release requests, rollout updates, and feedback.

4. Roles & Responsibilities

RM+SRE Team

Gatekeepers of production deployments.

Ensure no conflicts between application releases.

Execute staggered/canary rollouts.

Maintain rollback playbooks.

Provide transparent reporting to leadership.

Developers

Own testing and readiness validation.

Submit complete and documented release requests.

Act as SMEs (subject matter experts) during release validation.

5. Example Scenarios

High-Risk Feature Rollout
→ Deployed only to 1% of stores first, monitored before scaling up.

Patch Fix for Production Issue
→ Fast-tracked release, but still rolled out in staged phases.

Conflicting Requests
→ RM+SRE prioritizes one release and queues the other to maintain stability.

6. Benefits

For Developers:

Single interaction model (no App SRE middle layer).

Predictable rollout and feedback process.

For RM+SRE Team:

Centralized ownership of GDCE applications.

Simplified governance and reduced handoffs.

For Leadership:

Confidence in scaling to thousands of stores.

Central accountability and risk mitigation.

For Stores:

Safer updates with canary/staggered rollout strategy.

Reduced risk of widespread outages.

7. Next Steps

Expand RM+SRE team capacity.

Define release request templates and SLAs.

Automate staged rollout pipeline (1% → 5% → 25% → 100%).

Build dashboards for real-time rollout tracking and reporting.
