Release Management for GDCE Applications

(Unified RM + SRE Model)

1. Context

100+ GDCE-enabled stores already live, with more coming.

Apps are edge-specific and require consistent, reliable deployment practices.

To scale effectively â†’ consolidate into one Release Management + SRE team (RM+SRE).

2. Organizational Model

RM+SRE Team

Expanded group of SRE engineers with release management mandate.

Owns GitHub Config Sync repos (write access restricted to RM+SRE only).

Manages deployment pipelines, staggered rollouts, and monitoring.

Developers

Build & test apps in dev/staging environments.

Submit release requests directly to RM+SRE team.

Provide validation artifacts (unit tests, performance benchmarks).

3. Deployment Workflow
Step 1 â€“ Dev Testing

Developers validate functionality in lower tiers (unit, integration, load tests).

Step 2 â€“ Release Request

Dev team submits deployment request to RM+SRE.

Request includes manifests, validation evidence, and release notes.

Step 3 â€“ Staggered Deployment

RM+SRE executes controlled rollout strategy:

ðŸš¦ Phase 1: Deploy to 1% of stores (pilot).

ðŸš¦ Phase 2: Expand to 5% of stores (early validation).

ðŸš¦ Phase 3: Roll out to 25% of stores.

ðŸš¦ Phase 4: Full fleet rollout (100%).

Rollout can pause or rollback at any stage if issues detected.

Step 4 â€“ Monitoring & Validation

RM+SRE continuously monitors:

Application health.

Store connectivity.

Performance metrics.

Issues trigger immediate rollback plan.

Step 5 â€“ Communication

Teams Channel: Developers interact directly with RM+SRE for:

Release status updates.

Rollout progress dashboards.

Feedback loops.

4. Roles & Responsibilities
RM+SRE Team

Gatekeepers of production deployments.

Ensure no conflicts between parallel app releases.

Execute staggered/canary rollouts.

Own rollback playbooks.

Report release health to leadership.

Developers

Own testing & readiness validation.

Submit well-documented release requests.

Provide immediate SME (subject matter expert) support if rollout issues arise.

5. Example Scenarios

Scenario A â€“ High-Risk New Feature
â†’ Deploy only to 1% of stores, monitor error rates, expand gradually.

Scenario B â€“ Patch Fix for Outage
â†’ RM+SRE fast-tracks rollout but still stages: 1% â†’ 25% â†’ 100%.

Scenario C â€“ Conflicting Releases
â†’ RM+SRE team prioritizes one, queues the other to maintain stability.

6. Benefits

For Developers: Simplified interaction â†’ one team to handle all production rollouts.

For RM+SRE Team: Unified ownership of edge apps â†’ reduced handoffs.

For Leadership: Controlled growth â†’ confidence in scaling to 100s of stores without chaos.

For Stores: Safe updates â†’ gradual rollout reduces risk of widespread impact.

7. Next Steps

Expand RM+SRE team headcount for capacity.

Formalize release request template + SLAs.

Build automation for staged rollout percentages (1% â†’ 5% â†’ 25% â†’ 100%).

Provide dashboards for real-time rollout tracking.
